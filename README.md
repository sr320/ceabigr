# CEABiGR Workshop
Workshop on genomic data integration with a emphasis on integrating genetics, epigenetics, and trascriptional activity.
Workshop will take a case study based approach looking at specific data sets from oysters and corals. The workshop will take place at the Friday Harbor Labs with remote participation option 

**Dates**: February 21, 22

**Aim** - To develop manuscript(s), similar in fashion to FROGER üê∏ and develop genomic analysis pipeline to be used in future efforts. It is increasingly evident that we have to consider the combined molecular and physiological states to understand population responses to changing environmental condiditons. 



Prior to the workshop, participants will engage in [Discussions](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr/discussions) and [Wiki](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr/wiki) to share information including promising pipelines and relevant datasets.

## Monday
- Introductions
- Outline of goals including highlight efforts in other species
- Discuss best practices for workshop documentation and collaboration
- Brief summary of recent integrated genomic efforts by participants
- Focus on formatting, generating and genomic datasets (RNAseq, DNA methylation, lncRNA, ATAC, microbiome, metabolomics) in fashion to effectively interogate. Examples can be found on wiki including eg [gene expression](https://github.com/sr320/ceabigr/wiki/Gene-Expression-Data-Types)
- Develop plan for integration including machine learning, correlation analysis, etc

## Tuesday 
- Evaluate and carryout analyses. This includes both data (relationship) discovery and hypothesis testing.
- Regroup and discuss experiences and challenges
- Outline manuscripts
- Establish and publish robust, generalized pipelines for analysis
- Discuss future directions.

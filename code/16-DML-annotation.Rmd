Working with to dml files

```{bash}
head ../data/*dml.bed
```


```{bash}
wc -l ../data/*dml.bed
```



```{bash}
cd ../genome-features 

curl -O  https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/Cvirg_tracks/C_virginica-3.0_Gnomon_genes.bed
```


Where do these DMLs overlap in genome? 

```{bash}
/home/shared/bedtools2/bin/intersectBed \
-wb \
-a ../data/female_dml.bed \
-b ../genome-features/C_virginica-3.0_Gnomon_genes.bed | wc -l
```


```{bash}
head ../data/female_dml.bed
head ../genome-features/cgigas_uk_roslin_v1_gene.gff
```

```{bash}
/home/shared/bedtools2/bin/intersectBed \
-wb \
-a ../genome-features/cgigas_uk_roslin_v1_gene.gff \
-b ../genome-features/GCF_902806645.1_cgigas_uk_roslin_v1_genomic.gff

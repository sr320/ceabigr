Following Li et al. Will take bams and get some data..

Trimmed reads were mapped to the Aiptasia genome using HISAT2 v2.1.0, and mapping coverage per position was extracted using BEDTools v2.17.0. To assess spurious transcription levels, we deter- mined the coverage per exon normalized across all six replicates (assuming every replicate had a coverage of 1 million sequences in total) and then calculated the average coverage ratios of exons 2 to 6 versus exon 1 for every gene


Individual BAMS and their corresponding index files are in each individual sample subirectory:

A merged BAM of all samples is here (79GB):

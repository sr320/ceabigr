# 1.2 IDEOGRAM LABELS, TICKS, AND MODULARIZING CONFIGURATION
#
# In this tutorial, I will add tick marks, tick labels and ideogram
# labels to the previous image. This will require the use of a <ticks>
# block and expanding the <ideogram> block. 
#
# To make the configuration more modular, the tick and ideogram
# parameters will be stored in different files and imported using the
# <<include>> directive.
